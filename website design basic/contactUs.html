                Pizza is a worldwide favorite. The reason for pizza spread is that you can add anything to it and eat it
                anytime of the day and anywhere.

                The pizza originated in Italy and it is one of the favorite foods for adults and children.

                It was originally dough with topping of any ingredients as meat or vegetables that baked in the oven.
                Pizza developed to become more organized as Italians added sauce, cheese mozzarella and many other types
                of cheese. Such new way moved from Italy to other countries by Italian immigrants.

                Pizza arrived the Middle East and spread very quickly and become favorite.

                I’m not fond of pizza, I have pizza only once a month and when there are no options, this time I had
                dinner at the Pizza restaurant. The menu contained exciting varieties in terms of appetizers, pizza and
                pasta with a detail of the ingredients of each dish.

                The appetizers were a chicken soup with delicious cream.

                The second dish was a mushroom dish with pashamel sauce (cream sauce) and the onion was excellent and
                the mushroom was fresh.

                The third dish was garlic bread.

                Then we ordered three types of pizza, medium size divided into four pieces.

                The pizza dough was light and soft and its ingredients were excellent in terms of quantity and taste.

                The first was “Polo Kun Fungi” pizza. It was made of chicken, pashamel sauce and mushroom.

                The second was sausage pizza. It was made of sausage, mushroom sauce and mozzarella.

                It was very good but the first one was better.

                The third was romana diavolo pizza, which of the same dough but they extend the dough until it becomes
                bigger and thinner. It was made of beef, pepperoni, cold pepper and tomato sauce.

                Personally, I do not like meat in the pizza nor the pepperoni, so I did not like this pizza and it was
                very ordinary.

                The bill was fairly high but the quality of the pizza differed from other well known restaurants.

                After the interesting experience with this restaurant. I decided to have a weekly visit to a different
                pizza restaurant to try different pizza types and explore the best restaurant.

                Indeed, pizza can be eaten anytime, anywhere hot or cold.

                I became a pizza expert in a short time.
